Was trying to convert [edgelaser PHP](https://github.com/morgan-linux/edge-laser-simulator#edgelaserphp) to reactPHP, never got far but a fun learning experience of react and udp sockets.

First [run](https://github.com/morgan-linux/edge-laser-simulator#run-the-sauce) the simulator, then :

``` bash
$ composer install
$ php react.php
```
